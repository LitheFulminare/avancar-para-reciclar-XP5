This explains the error I'm having.
Basically has to do with resources, nodes and the GameManager autoload script

After making the moving the card and making it bigger its own function, the 
'await tween.finished' part simply doesn't work, the function that called won't wait.
maybe I should put await tween_function() or something, I have to do some research

I DISABLED MAP BUTTON BEING VISIBLE, TURN IT ON LATER


on the _on_animated_sprite_2d_animation_finished() of the Dice class I could emit the
second_dice_landed as soon as the animation stops, then the action that listen to this
signal can do the countdown. I think doing a await timer and await tween on the same
func could create problems, so I avoided this
