This explains the error I'm having.
Basically has to do with resources, nodes and the GameManager autoload script

After answering the question a signal is emitted to the player_answered() func
The state is changed to end_turn, action() is called again and it detects that the turn has ended
Now I just have to make the end_turn part its own function and automate the turn change functionality


I DISABLED MAP BUTTON BEING VISIBLE, TURN IT ON LATER
