TODO:

>> Finish square action stuff
	- it's all setup already, just need to code the action themselves

>> Implement discard trash thing when getting an answer right and when wining minigame
	- can reuse the "discard trash square" script since it's the same principle

>> Create a preparation scene before the minigame, just like Mario Party - and show controls

>> Show controls when choosing to navigate through the map and on the minigame

(Arthur stuff)

>> Change quiz square icon to match new question mark font

>> Ajust branch 1 A (it's overlapping with the HUD)

(Caio)

>> Change trash card icon, the style doesn't match

>> Change luck card icon, arthur updated the colors


PARTIALLY DONE

>> Create a right/wrong feedback when answering a question card
	- (done) make right answer green and the wrong ones red
	- play a sound reflecting whether it's right or wrong
	- (done) put a text above the card "Correct!", "Wrong"

>> Visual feedback of dice rolling
	- still not happy with the result, when on second roll it doesn't show the result of the first one. But it's a matter of taste

>> Visual feedback of how many the player can walk
	- done, needs some polishing, maybe add a background (ask the rest of the guys)


DONE

>> Make player able to navigate the camera through the map

>> Spawn buttons to choose branch
	- done, buttons change color depending on the player's color

>> Go to minigame when finishing a round
	- (done) easy, just use game_manager.go_to_scene()

>> Finish trash card spawn
	- (done) create a card background
	- (done) make it appear on screen
	- (done) make it move to the player and shrink till it disappears (use tween)

>> Some sort of feedback when starting a game, changing turns, rounds, "Hora do minigame!" and game end
	- (done) can reuse some of  the logic on the boat minigame to display this stuff

>> Save and load state when going to a minigame scene and then going back to the board scene
	- (used GameManager) not sure whether I'll use GameManager or create a new autoload, or a new thing I haven't learned yet. Still have to do some research
