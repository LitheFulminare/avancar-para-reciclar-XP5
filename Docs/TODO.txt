TODO:

>> Visual feedback of dice rolling

>> Visual feedback of how many the player can walk

>> Spawn buttons to choose branch

>> Finish trash card spawn
	- create a card background
	- make it appear on screen
	- make it move to the player and shrink till it disappears (use tween)

>> Finish square action stuff
	- prob will create a resource for each of them containing a script that will be run

>> Implement discard trash thing when getting an answer right
	- can reuse the "discard trash square" script since it's the same principle

>> Save and load state when going to a minigame scene and then going back to the board scene
	- not sure whether I'll use GameManager or create a new autoload, or a new thing I haven't learned yet. Still have to do some research

>> Create a preparation scene before the minigame, just like Mario Party - and show controls

>> Make player able to navigate the camera through the map and show controls

(Arthur stuff)

>> Change quiz square icon to match new question mark font

>> Ajust branch 1 A (it's overlapping with the HUD



PARTIALLY DONE

>> Create a right/wrong feedback when answering a question card
	- (done) make right answer green and the wrong ones red
	- play a sound reflecting whether it's right or wrong
	- (done) put a text above the card "Correct!", "Wrong"

>> Go to minigame when finishing a round
	- (done) easy, just use game_manager.go_to_scene()

DONE

>> Some sort of feedback when starting a game, changing turns, rounds, "Hora do minigame!" and game end
	- (done) can reuse some of  the logic on the boat minigame to display this stuff
