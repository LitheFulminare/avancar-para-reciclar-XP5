>> BUG 1 (prob fixed, will have to examine carefully later)

When on branch 1 A or fork 1, if total_dice_result is going to make the player leave the branch, it goes past the fork 2

The cause is:
	if active_player.current_branch == path_manager.branches.branch_A:
		if active_player.current_square + remaining_distance > active_player.current_branch_end:
			active_player.current_square += active_player.opposite_branch_length

It changes active_player.current_square and doesn't check whether there is a fork on the way


>> BUG 2

When on branch 1 A, if the dice roll exceeds fork 2, the player will stop but won't trigger the fork interaction (asking to choose branch)


>> BUG 3 

When on fork 2, choosing branch A won't move the player, only branch B works

>> BUG 4

Not really a bug, but I have to finish implementing the closed circuit logic when leaving branch 2

>> BUG 5

Sometimes when on fork 1, choosing a branch won't make the player move. I think it's when they land exactly on the fork and only choose one
of the branches on the next round
