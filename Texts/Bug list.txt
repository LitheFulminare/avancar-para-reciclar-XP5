>> BUG 1

When on branch 1 A or fork 1, if total_dice_result is going to make the player leave the branch, it goes past the fork 2

The cause is:
	if active_player.current_branch == path_manager.branches.branch_A:
		if active_player.current_square + remaining_distance > active_player.current_branch_end:
			active_player.current_square += active_player.opposite_branch_length

It changes active_player.current_square and doesn't check whether there is a fork on the way
